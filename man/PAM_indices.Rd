\title{Biodiversity indices derived from PAM}
\usage{
PAM_indices(PAM, indices = "all", exclude_column = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{PAM}{matrix, data.frame, or base_PAM object containing information on
species presence and absence for a set of sites. Sites are organized in the
rows and species in the columns. See details.}

\item{indices}{(character) code for indices to be calculated. Basic indices
are calculated all the time; other indices need to be specified. Options are:
"all", "basic, "AB", "BW", "BL", "SCSC", "SCSR", "DF", "CC", "WRN", "SRC",
"CMSC", "CMSR", "MCC", and "MRC". Default = "all". See details.}

\item{exclude_column}{(optional) name or numeric index of columns to be
excluded. Default = NULL.}
}
\value{
If \code{PAM} is a matrix or data.frame, the result is a list with the
results described below (depending on \code{indices}). If \code{PAM} is a
base_PAM object, a base_PAM object will be returned and the list described
above will be appended to the element PAM_indices in such an element.
}
\description{
Calculates a set of biodiversity indices using values contained
in a presence-absence matrix.
}
\details{
Descriptions of the codes of all indices to be calculated are presented in
the table below. If \code{indices} = "basic", only basic indices are
calculated. However, basic indices are calculated in all cases not matter the
code(s) defined in \code{indices}. Some indices require previous calculations
of other indices, in such cases, all indices required are added to the final
list. For further details on the way calculations are performed and the
meaning of the indices see Sober√≥n and Cavner (2015)
